# Machine-Learning-Nanodegree
This repository includes code implementations and reports for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree (MLND) projects. Laid out below is a brief of these projects.

- Project 0 - Titanic Survival: In this project, the goal is to predict the number of survivors from the 1912 Titanic ship disaster based on each passenger's features.

- Project 1 - Predicting Boston Housing Prices: The task is to build an optimal model based on boston housing prices dataset. This model will then be utilized by a real estate company to estimate the best selling price for their clients' homes.

- Project 2 - Customer Segments: In this project, it's required to predict people that are most likely to donate to CharityML foundation. This was done by applying supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census.
