# Machine-Learning-Nanodegree
This repository includes code implementations and reports for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree **(MLND)** projects. Laid out below is a brief of these projects.

**- Project 0 - Titanic Survival:** In this project, the goal is to predict the number of survivors from the 1912 Titanic ship disaster based on each passenger's features.

**- Project 1 - Predicting Boston Housing Prices:** The task is to build an optimal model based on boston housing prices dataset. This model will then be utilized by a real estate company to estimate the best selling price for their clients' homes.

**- Project 2 - Finding Donors:** In this project, it's required to predict the people that are most likely to donate to CharityML foundation. This was done by applying supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census.

**- Project 3 - Dog Breed Classifier:** In this project, I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network **(CNN)** to predcit dog breeds. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm identifies an estimate of the cannine's breed. If the CNN was supplied with a human's image, it will output the closest resembling dog breed.

**- Project 4 - Creating Customer Segments:** In this project, it's required to analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
